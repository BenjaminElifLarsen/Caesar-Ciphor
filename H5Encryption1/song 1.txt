Spears agleam in the dying sun
The blood is spilled, the battle's won
From the icy throne of God-King shall rule
When nine stars kiss the moon o'er Ultima Thule

Old Northlander war-song, found in the ancient scrolls of Volmyr

The Final Part of Voryn Helmsmiter's Journey to the Ice Realm: Blood
Drips from my frost-encased sword, forming a crimson blossom upon the ice...
My limbs cold, becoming as one with the massing snows... my eyes nearly frozen
Closed. For how long had we travelled? The memory grows dim, lost in the
Cruel, searing storm-winds. And now, at last... our quest is at an end. With
The blessings of the elders we began our journey beyond the great veil of
Shadowed glaciers... They spoke of a prophecy foretold, an ancient and
Glorious legacy, A quest for the realm of legendry lost to man since before
Even the Star-Lords descended... Now, only I survive, my blood spilling to the
Ice, turning to crimson crystal upon the deeply frozen earth. Elder sorcery
Crackles and hums all about me, coursing through the sky, the snow... As grim
Destiny approaches with the freezing boreal gales and this ancient prophecy
Unfolds...
Predication of the Elders:
Go, follow the witch-lights in the northern night sky, beyond the great
Silvern mountains... Let the sacred moon-crystal be your guide, beware the
Sentinels at the Caverns of Eternal Mist...
